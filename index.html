    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
    <h3>Hello there!</h3>
    <h3>Self called 'Chef' here (hehe). The recipes 
        I'm gonna share are all homemade basic stuffs. 
        These are the things that I cook myself to cheer 
        myself up when I feel there's too much going on in life
        (cryinggg)
