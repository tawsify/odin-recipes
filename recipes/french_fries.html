     <h3>This will be a very basic recipe for French Fries.
        Can be made if we have the following basic home ingredients:
     </h3>
     <ol>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Chilli Flakes</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Corn Flour</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
     </ol>
     <h3>Steps: </h3>
     <ol>
        <li>At first, take a bowl with some water to boil. Turn your stove and put 
            the bowl on it, wait until the water starts to boil. 
        </li>
        <li> While the water is on the stove, take the potatoes, peeling them off and cut them into pieces. Make sure to wash the potatoes after cutting.
        </li>
        <li> After our water starts boiling, put the potatoes into the bowl and cover them up. Take a timer and wait for 3/4 minutes</li>
        <li>After the timer goes off, scoop them up and put them in cold water for few minutes. Then put them onto a kitchen towel. We want the extra water to be gone</li>   
        <li>While they are soaking like good potatoes, take the frying pan where you want to fry. Keep in mind, we want to fry them in deep oil. So, 
            put enough oil and wait until they are hot enough
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cover the potatoe slices with corn flour.
             Put them all in a bowl and mix corn flour with them 
             thoroughly 
        </li>
        <li>Now, it frying timeeee. Carefully fry them until they are brown and crispy outside.
            After the frying has been done, put them in a bowl again and mix chilli flakes, salt and black pepper as your taste.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>We are done making our French Fries. Do you know
        what they taste best with ? 
    </h3>
    <p>They taste best with some <b>'Garlic Mayo'. </b> And that's very easy to make at home.
        Gonna share the recipe of the mayo another day.
